Conference Question Vote

# Introduction
Conference Question Vote (CQV) is a mini full stack MEAN app using my tiny express based framework (https://github.com/dezashibi/express_micro_api) , Mongoose , Angular 4

Users can ask their questions and vote for their related questions

admin and moderator can view questions and delete them if question is inappropriate or mark question as answered so that the question no longer can be voted.

attendees can mention their name or not and vote for a question only once.

## Installation
installation is easy 

1. clone git repo
2. `cd cqv`
3. `cd client`
4. `npm install`
5. `cd ../server`
6. `npm install`


then switch to /client folder and run `ng build`, output files will be available in `/server/public` filder

now you can run server by cd into server folder and running `node server.js`


thank's it
